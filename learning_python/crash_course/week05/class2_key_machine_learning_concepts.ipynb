    "# Class 2 Practice: Key Machine Learning Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Week 5, Class 2! Today, we’ll dive into the foundational concepts of machine learning: **features**, **labels**, **training/testing data**, and **overfitting/underfitting**. This notebook will guide you through these ideas with examples and exercises to prepare you for building ML models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "- Understand **features** and **labels** in a dataset.\n",
    "- Learn why we split data into **training** and **testing** sets.\n",
    "- Explore **overfitting** and **underfitting** and their impact on models.\n",
    "- Practice identifying these concepts in a sample dataset."

    "## 1. Features and Labels\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, data is organized into **features** and **labels**:\n",
    "- **Features**: The input variables used to make predictions. Think of them as the \"questions\" the model uses.\n",
    "  - Example: For predicting house prices, features might be size (sqft), number of bedrooms, and location.\n",
    "- **Labels**: The output variable we want to predict. This is the \"answer\" the model learns.\n",
    "  - Example: For house prices, the label is the actual price ($).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy**: Imagine baking a cake. Features are the ingredients (flour, sugar, eggs), and the label is the cake’s taste (good or bad).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**: Suppose you’re predicting whether a student passes an exam. What might be one feature and the label?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Answer**:  \n",
    "- Feature: [Type here, e.g., 'Hours studied']  \n",
    "- Label: [Type here, e.g., 'Pass or fail']"

    "## 2. Training and Testing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a reliable model, we split our dataset into:\n",
    "- **Training Data**: Used to teach the model (e.g., 80% of the data).\n",
    "- **Testing Data**: Used to evaluate the model’s performance on unseen data (e.g., 20% of the data).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why split?** Without a test set, the model might just memorize the training data and fail on new data—like studying only the exact questions on a practice test but failing the real exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: If you have 100 house price records, you might use 80 to train and 20 to test.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**: Why is it bad to test a model on the same data it was trained on?\n",

    "**Your Answer**: [Type here, e.g., 'It might memorize the data and not generalize to new examples.']"

    "## 3. Overfitting and Underfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Models can fail in two ways:\n",
    "- **Overfitting**: The model learns the training data *too well*, including noise, and performs poorly on new data.\n",
    "  - Example: A model that predicts house prices perfectly for your 80 training houses but fails on new houses.\n",
    "- **Underfitting**: The model is too simple and doesn’t learn enough from the training data, performing poorly on both training and testing.\n",
    "  - Example: Predicting house prices using only the number of windows (not enough info).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy**: Overfitting is like memorizing answers without understanding; underfitting is like not studying enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**: If a model gets 100% accuracy on training data but only 50% on testing data, is it overfitting or underfitting? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Answer**: [Type here, e.g., 'Overfitting, because it performs too well on training but poorly on testing.']"
