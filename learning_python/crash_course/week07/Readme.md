# Week 7: Unsupervised Learning and Advanced Data Analysis

## Overview
Welcome to Week 7! This week, we dive into **unsupervised learning** and techniques for analyzing complex datasets. You'll learn how to group data without labels, reduce dataset complexity, explore data distributions, and evaluate models robustly. By the end, you'll apply these skills in a mini-project to cluster and interpret real-world data.

**Objective**: Understand and apply unsupervised learning techniques to analyze high-dimensional datasets effectively.

## Topics Covered
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering (k-means), dimensionality reduction (Principal Component Analysis - PCA).
- **Data Exploration**: Histograms, box plots, correlation analysis.
- **Feature Selection**: Removing low-variance features, correlation-based selection.
- **Model Evaluation**: Introduction to cross-validation for robust analysis.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of Week 7, you will be able to:
- Apply k-means clustering to group data (e.g., customer segmentation).
- Use PCA to reduce dataset dimensions and visualize high-dimensional data.
- Analyze data distributions using histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps.
- Select relevant features to improve model performance.
- Evaluate unsupervised models using metrics like silhouette score and cross-validation.
- Complete a mini-project to cluster a dataset and interpret the results.

## Class Breakdown
This week’s material is divided into four classes to build your skills progressively:

1. **Class 1: Introduction to Unsupervised Learning and Clustering**
   - Topics: Unsupervised learning basics, k-means clustering.
   - Activities: Apply k-means to a dataset and visualize clusters.
   
2. **Class 2: Dimensionality Reduction with PCA**
   - Topics: PCA concepts, variance explained, visualization.
   - Activities: Reduce a dataset’s dimensions using PCA and interpret results.
   
3. **Class 3: Exploring Data Distributions and Feature Selection**
   - Topics: Histograms, box plots, correlation analysis, feature selection.
   - Activities: Visualize data distributions and select features based on variance and correlation.
   
4. **Class 4: Cross-Validation and Mini-Project**
   - Topics: Cross-validation, synthesizing skills for clustering.
   - Activities: Cluster the mall customer dataset, apply PCA, and interpret results in a mini-project.

## Mini-Project
You’ll cluster a dataset (e.g., mall customer data) using k-means, apply PCA for visualization, and select features to preprocess the data. The goal is to identify meaningful groups (e.g., customer segments) and present your findings. You’ll start this in Class 4 and finalize it as homework.

## Setup Instructions
To participate in the hands-on exercises and mini-project, set up the following:
1. **Python Environment**:
   - Install Python 3.8+.
   - Use a virtual environment (optional but recommended): `python -m venv env`.
   - Activate it: `source env/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `env\Scripts\activate` (Windows).
2. **Required Libraries**:
   - Install via pip: `pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn`.
3. **Jupyter Notebook** (recommended for exercises):
   - Install: `pip install jupyter`.
   - Launch: `jupyter notebook`.
4. **Dataset**:
   - Download the mall customer dataset (provided in class or via link: [Mall_Customers.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)).
   - Place it in your working directory.

  - [Scikit-learn: PCA](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/decomposition.html#pca)
  - [Matplotlib: Visualizations](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/index.html)
  - [Seaborn: Heatmaps and Box Plots](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html)
- **Datasets**:
  - Mall customer dataset (linked above).
  - Optional: Iris dataset (available in scikit-learn: `from sklearn.datasets import load_iris`).
- **Additional Reading**:
  - "Introduction to Machine Learning with Python" by Müller and Guido (Chapters on unsupervised learning).
  - [Cross-Validation in Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html).

## Instructions for Students
1. Attend all four classes to build skills progressively.
2. Complete the in-class exercises to practice k-means, PCA, and data visualization.
3. Work on the mini-project in Class 4 and finalize it as homework.
4. Submit your mini-project (code and a short write-up or presentation) by the deadline provided in class.
5. Reach out to the instructor for help with setup, code, or concepts!

## Notes
- Ensure your Python environment is set up before Class 1 to follow along with demos.
- The mini-project focuses on the mall customer dataset, but you can explore other datasets with instructor approval.
- Collaboration is encouraged for exercises, but submit individual mini-project work.

Happy learning, and let’s uncover hidden patterns in data together!
