# Week 10: Advanced Topics and Capstone Project

## Overview
Welcome to Week 10 of the AI course! This week introduces advanced AI concepts, consolidates prior learning, and culminates in a capstone project where students apply their skills to a real-world problem. Through hands-on exercises and project work, students will explore natural language processing (NLP), sequence models, model deployment, and AI ethics, building a portfolio-worthy project.

## Objectives
- Understand advanced AI topics, including NLP, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and transformers.
- Learn to deploy AI models using simple APIs.
- Explore ethical considerations in AI, such as bias and fairness.
- Apply knowledge to design, implement, and present an end-to-end AI project.

## Topics Covered
1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
   - Text preprocessing: tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming/lemmatization.
   - Bag-of-words model and its limitations.
   - Introduction to word embeddings (e.g., word2vec, GloVe).
2. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers**:
   - Basics of RNNs: architecture, sequence modeling, vanishing gradient problem.
   - High-level overview of transformers and the attention mechanism.
3. **Model Deployment**:
   - Saving and loading models (e.g., using pickle, TensorFlow SavedModel).
   - Creating a simple API with Flask to serve model predictions.
4. **Ethical Considerations in AI**:
   - Bias in data and models.
   - Fairness, transparency, and real-world implications.
   - Case studies (e.g., biased algorithms in hiring or criminal justice).

## Weekly Schedule
The material is divided into four classes to ensure progressive learning and hands-on practice:

### Class 1: Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- **Focus**: Learn NLP fundamentals and text preprocessing.
- **Activities**:
  - Lecture on NLP concepts and applications.
  - Hands-on exercise: Preprocess text data (e.g., movie reviews) using NLTK or spaCy and implement a bag-of-words model for sentiment classification.
  - Discussion on preprocessing challenges.
- **Outcome**: Ability to preprocess text and apply basic NLP techniques.

### Class 2: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers Overview
- **Focus**: Understand sequence models and modern NLP architectures.
- **Activities**:
  - Lecture on RNNs and transformers (high-level, intuitive).
  - Hands-on exercise: Train a sentiment analysis model using a pre-built RNN (e.g., LSTM in Keras) or transformer (e.g., Hugging Faceâ€™s DistilBERT).
  - Q&A on sequence models.
- **Outcome**: Familiarity with RNNs/transformers and using pre-trained models.

### Class 3: Model Deployment and Ethical Considerations
- **Focus**: Deploy models and explore AI ethics.
- **Activities**:
  - Lecture on saving/loading models, Flask APIs, and AI ethics (with case studies).
  - Hands-on exercise: Save a trained model and create a Flask API to serve predictions.
  - Group discussion on potential biases in AI projects.
- **Outcome**: Ability to deploy a model and awareness of ethical issues.

### Class 4: Capstone Project Work and Presentation Prep
- **Focus**: Implement and prepare to present the capstone project.
- **Activities**:
  - Mini-lecture on project structure and presentation tips.
  - Project work session: Collect/preprocess data, train/evaluate a model, and create visualizations.
  - Prep for a 5-minute presentation (problem, approach, results, challenges, ethics).
- **Outcome**: Significant progress on a portfolio-worthy project.

## Capstone Project
The capstone project is the highlight of Week 10, allowing students to showcase their AI skills. Students will:
- Choose a project (e.g., image classification, text sentiment analysis, predictive modeling).
- Complete the following steps:
  1. Collect and preprocess a dataset.
  2. Train and evaluate a machine learning or deep learning model.
  3. Visualize results (e.g., confusion matrix, loss curves) and derive insights.
- Present findings in a 5-minute talk, covering:
  - Problem statement.
  - Methodology and model choice.
  - Results and visualizations.
  - Challenges faced.
  - Ethical considerations.

**Example Project Ideas**:
- Classify spam emails using NLP.
- Predict house prices with regression models.
- Build an image classifier for handwritten digits (MNIST).
- Perform sentiment analysis on social media posts.

**Requirements**:
- Use at least one evaluation metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score).
- Include at least one visualization.
- Address potential biases or ethical concerns in the project.
