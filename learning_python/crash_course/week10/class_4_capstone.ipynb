    "This notebook is your workspace for implementing your **capstone project**, the culmination of Week 10. You’ll collect and preprocess data, train and evaluate a model, create visualizations, and prepare a presentation to showcase your work. This class ties together everything you’ve learned: NLP (Class 1), RNNs/transformers (Class 2), and deployment/ethics (Class 3).\n",

    "- **Text Sentiment Analysis**: Classify movie reviews as positive/negative (like Classes 1–2).\n",
    "- **Image Classification**: Identify objects in photos (e.g., cats vs. dogs).\n",
    "- **Predictive Modeling**: Forecast house prices or stock trends.\n",

    "**Project Steps**:\n",
    "1. Collect and preprocess a dataset.\n",
    "2. Train and evaluate a machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) model.\n",
