# Week 9: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Image Processing

## Overview
Welcome to Week 9 of the course! This module dives into **deep learning for computer vision**, focusing on **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and their application to image processing tasks. By the end of this week, you will understand how CNNs work, how to preprocess image data, and how to leverage pre-trained models for image classification.

## Learning Objectives
- Explore the fundamentals of computer vision and image data representation.
- Understand the architecture of CNNs, including convolutions, pooling, and fully connected layers.
- Learn image preprocessing techniques such as resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.
- Apply **transfer learning** using pre-trained models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) to solve image classification tasks.

## Topics Covered
1. **Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Data**
   - What is computer vision? (e.g., object detection, image classification)
   - Image data: pixels, RGB channels, and dimensions.
   - Challenges: high dimensionality, variability in images.
2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
   - Core components: convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers.
   - Role of activation functions (e.g., ReLU).
   - Why CNNs are effective for image data.
3. **Preprocessing Images**
   - Resizing images to consistent dimensions.
   - Normalizing pixel values (e.g., scaling to [0,1]).
   - Data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, flipping, zooming).
4. **Transfer Learning**
   - Using pre-trained models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) for faster training.
   - Feature extraction vs. fine-tuning.
   - Practical application to image classification tasks.

## Activities
- **Exercises**:
  - Load and preprocess image data (e.g., CIFAR-10 dataset).
  - Build and train a simple CNN for image classification.
- **Mini-Project**:
  - Use transfer learning with a pre-trained model to classify images (e.g., cats vs. dogs).
  - Evaluate model performance and visualize predictions.

## Expected Outcomes
By the end of Week 9, you will be able to:
- Load and preprocess image datasets for deep learning.
- Design and train a basic CNN for image classification.
- Apply transfer learning to solve real-world image classification problems efficiently.
