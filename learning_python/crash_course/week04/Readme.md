Week 4: Intermediate Python and Data Preprocessing
Overview
Week 4 focuses on building essential skills for preparing data for AI models, a critical step in any AI workflow. Students will deepen their Python knowledge through advanced pandas, data preprocessing techniques, file handling, and an introduction to object-oriented programming (OOP). By the end, students will preprocess a real-world dataset and understand how to make data AI-ready.

Duration: 4 classes (~1.5 hours each)

Objective: Equip students to clean, transform, and structure datasets for machine learning applications.

Learning Objectives
Master advanced pandas for data manipulation (grouping, merging, handling missing data).
Apply data preprocessing techniques (normalization, standardization, feature encoding, outlier detection).
Handle diverse file formats (JSON, CSV) efficiently.
Understand basic OOP concepts (classes, objects, methods) and their relevance to data workflows.
Complete a mini-project to preprocess a real-world dataset (Titanic) for analysis.
