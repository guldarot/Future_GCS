# Week 1: Introduction to Python Programming

## Overview
This repository contains the materials and exercises for **Week 1** of the Python programming course. The focus is to introduce students to Python basics, set up a development environment, and explore foundational programming concepts. By the end of the week, students will be able to write simple Python programs and understand basic syntax.

## Objectives
- Understand why Python is widely used for AI and its real-world applications.
- Set up a Python development environment with an IDE (e.g., VSCode, Jupyter Notebook).
- Learn Python basics: variables, data types (int, float, string, boolean), and operators.
- Practice basic input/output operations and string manipulation.
- Explore control structures: if-else statements and loops (for, while).



## Installation
To set up the environment and run the Week 1 code, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python**:
   - Download and install Python (version 3.10 or higher) from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Verify installation by running:
     ```bash
     python --version
