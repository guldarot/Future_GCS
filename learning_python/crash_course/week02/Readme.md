# Week 2: Python Data Structures and Functions

Welcome to **Week 2** of our Python programming course! This week, we dive deeper into Python's core features, focusing on data structures, functions, error handling, and modules. By the end, you'll be able to manipulate data efficiently and write modular, robust code.

## Overview

**Objective**: Learn to handle data with Python's built-in structures, create reusable functions, manage errors, and use external modules to extend functionality.

**Structure**: The week is divided into four classes, each with a Jupyter Notebook containing explanations, demos, exercises, and a mini-project or challenge. The classes build on each other, progressing from basic data manipulation to practical applications.

### Class Breakdown

1. **Class 1: Lists and Tuples** (`Class1_Lists_Tuples.ipynb`)
   - **Topics**: Creating and manipulating lists and tuples, indexing, slicing, list methods (e.g., `append`, `sort`), iteration with for loops.
   - **Activities**: Exercises to sort lists, slice tuples, and iterate over items.
   - **Mini-Challenge**: Combine list methods, slicing, and iteration to process a list and create a tuple.
   - **Outcome**: Understand mutable (lists) vs. immutable (tuples) sequences and how to work with them.

2. **Class 2: Dictionaries, Sets, and List Comprehensions** (`Class2_Dictionaries_Sets_Comprehensions.ipynb`)
   - **Topics**: Creating dictionaries (key-value pairs), sets (unique items), dictionary methods (e.g., `get`, `pop`), set operations (e.g., `union`, `intersection`), list comprehensions for concise coding.
   - **Activities**: Exercises to build a phonebook dictionary, find common items with sets, and generate lists with comprehensions.
   - **Mini-Challenge**: Integrate dictionaries, sets, and list comprehensions to analyze inventory data.
   - **Outcome**: Master key-value storage, unique collections, and efficient list creation.

3. **Class 3: Functions and Scope** (`Class3_Functions_Scope.ipynb`)
   - **Topics**: Defining functions, parameters, return statements, default/keyword arguments, local vs. global scope.
   - **Activities**: Exercises to write functions for multiplication, tax calculation, and scope exploration.
   - **Mini-Challenge**: Create a palindrome checker function with a case-sensitive option.
   - **Outcome**: Write reusable functions and understand variable accessibility.

4. **Class 4: Error Handling and Modules** (`Class4_ErrorHandling_Modules.ipynb`)
   - **Topics**: Try-except blocks, handling specific exceptions (e.g., `ValueError`, `ZeroDivisionError`), importing modules (`math`, `random`).
   - **Activities**: Exercises to handle division errors and use module functions (e.g., `math.sqrt`, `random.randint`).
   - **Mini-Project**: Build a simple calculator with functions, error handling, and module support (e.g., `math.pow`).
   - **Outcome**: Create robust programs that handle errors and leverage Python's module ecosystem.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python**: Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Install via `pip install notebook` to run `.ipynb` files.
- **Text Editor**: Optional for viewing `.ipynb` files as JSON (e.g., VS Code).

### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone or Download**: Download this directory containing the four Jupyter Notebooks.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `pip install jupyter` if Jupyter Notebook is not installed.
3. **Launch Jupyter**:
   - Open a terminal in this directory.
   - Run `jupyter notebook` to start the Jupyter server.
   - Open each notebook (`Class1_Lists_Tuples.ipynb`, etc.) in the browser.
4. **Run Notebooks**:
   - Follow the instructions in each notebook.
   - Run demo cells to see examples, complete "Try It Yourself" exercises, and tackle the mini-challenge/project.
   - Save your work after completing exercises.
