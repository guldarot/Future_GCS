Week 8: Introduction to Neural Networks and Deep Learning
Welcome to Week 8! This module introduces deep learning, a powerful area of AI, focusing on neural networks and hands-on implementation using TensorFlow. Over four classes, you’ll learn the fundamentals of neural networks, build and train models, and apply them to classification tasks. By the end, you’ll complete a mini-project comparing neural networks to traditional machine learning models.

Objective
Transition to deep learning by understanding neural networks.
Build and train a basic neural network for classification using TensorFlow.
Compare neural network performance with scikit-learn models.
Topics
Core Concepts: Neurons, layers, activation functions (e.g., ReLU, softmax).
TensorFlow Basics: Building a simple neural network with Keras.
Training Process: Forward/backward propagation, gradient descent, loss functions.
Practical Application: Training feedforward neural networks for classification (e.g., Iris, MNIST digits).
Comparison: Evaluating neural networks against scikit-learn models (e.g., SVM, logistic regression).
